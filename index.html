    <h2>What this calculator does</h2>
    <p>This calculator calculates rubber and plastic oil loops for Satisfactory.<br>
    If you do not want to produce fuel, and instead want to produce a different heavy oil residue product, or just heavy oil residue:<br>
    Enter the equivelant amount of fuel.</p>
    <h2>What is an oil loop?</h2>
    <p>An oil loop, or a plastic/rubber/fuel loop is a way of making plastics and rubbers in Satisfactory.<br>
    It is the most efficient way to do so, as it resuses polymer resin byproducts when making heavy oil residue,<br>
    and uses the heavy oil residue to make fuel, which is used with the recycled rubber and recycled plastic recipes to maximise output.</p>
